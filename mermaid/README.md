# Mermaid
Mermaid is a diagramming tool that allows you to create diagrams as code. It's also a JS library, but we're not focusing on that. I think the only way to learn it is by doing, which is funny to say since that's obvious. Okay I'll just the notes here.

But I'm guessing it's just best to work through all the examples they have. Then work videos from other creators on using the tool. Then finally at the end  Ican truly see whether I like the tool or not. But honestly I don't think the tool and using the tool is the top priority for us.
