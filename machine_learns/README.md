# Machine Learning Notes
Not going to be that theoretical or mathematical. The motivation for doing this is to be able to build cool (research-esque) projects. As well as building up the skills to be able to work with other researchers and do cutting edge like projects. 


## General Notes Guidelines
- Notes should be concise, and shorter than the book.
- At the end we should connect to previous chapters, ask or answer extra questions, and do a tldr in my own words what the chapter or little section as about.
- I'll try to keep the markdown files focused on a specific or related ideas. Trying not to overbloat files.
- Usually I'm going to have the technical definition and explanation. Then I'll break it down into human terms. The former is for when I need to implement and gets the rules right whilst the latter is for explanining something quick. 
- Each chapter should have a small project that can be done in a week or 2. They should build on current chapter concepts and previous.
- Should have code snippets where we experiment on "What happens if I change this parameter?", "How would this affect our program?".


## BOOK MARK:




## Credit
Apparently these are some good resources to follow for ML, and later computer vision and image processing.

Phase 1:
Sets the foundation for ML. It'd be nice to be able to implement standard algorithms from scratch, or at least know what each does, when to use them, and the trade offs.

- "Hands On Machine Learning" By Aurelien Geron
- "Introduction to Statistical Learning" (James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani). An ML-focused statistics book that covers theory and implementation. Pretty good for reference if you run into a roadblock, maybe look in here.
- "Python ML" by Sebastian Raschika. Pretty good conceptually at least.
- Andrew Ng has good courses on ML.

Phase 2:
More about deep learning and computer vision. At the end you should be able to build and deploy computer vision systems, and understand deep learning architecture tradeoffs.

- "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow.
- "Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications" by Richard Szeliski. 
- "Digital Image Processing" by Woodds Gonzales
- PyImageSearch's Computer Vision and OpenCV tutorials. A good mix of handson and theory
- "CS231n: Deep Learning for Computer Vision" - Stanford
