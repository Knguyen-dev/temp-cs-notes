### Dependencies
- Python: 3.5.2 or higher, but use the most recent version of python 3.

These are the versions of libraries that were used to write the book:
- NumPy 1.12.1
- SciPy 0.19.0
- scikit-learn 0.18.1
- Matplotlib 2.0.2
- pandas 0.20.1

### Project setup


1. Install Anaconda
2. Install Vscode
3. Git graph
4. Live share
5. Material icon theme, prettier, Git lens. Python extension, jupyter

Just install conda. It actually gets quite complex when installing stuff manualy with pip and whatnot. I'd recommend using cloud powered anaconda so that you 
can access things anywhere and you won't lose your stuff.

Just open anaconda app. Then launch jupyter notebook. After a bit, the jupyter notebook should launch in your browser. You should see your 
own file directory. Then you select the notebook that you're going to be running those python code in and whatnot.

### Setting up a formatter on save
1. Download "black formatter" by microsoft
2. Download "isort"
3. Open settings (ctrl + comma)

BOOK MARK: I mean we can keep copy and pasting code, but I'm going to just keep reading 
and at least understanding the process behind what he's doing.
