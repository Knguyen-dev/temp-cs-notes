# Distributed Systems Notes 
Ideally to make these concepts and ideas connect you should mention real life examples of why you want to use something, and what situation to use it in. Then of course we would do a little homework assignment teaching us how to do a certain thing. Or a least proof of concepts for some code snippets. 
- I already have some distributed systems notes, but I feel that some of the concepts that I put out there aren't really sitting concretely with me. I feel like each chapter I put out should have examples of small projects or homework assignments that can we used to fully understand what's happening.
- I guess there are special things like common distributed systems patterns, like paxos, raft, leader election. There's also circuit breaking. I'd like to do a couple of projects in this subject. Just the interesting ones would be fine. But yeah make sure to cover these. 
- TODO: Should probably complete some of those concurrency notes as well
