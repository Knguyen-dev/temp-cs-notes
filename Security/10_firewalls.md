# Firewalls

### What is a firewall
It's a device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on some security policies. Essentially a barrier that sits between your private internal network and the broader public internet. Firewalls started off as packet filters, and packet filtering firewalls still exist today but now firewalls have a lot more capabilities. From static filtering to now being backed by machine learning and context awareness.

### Types of firewalls

# TODO
This is still incomplete unfortunately. I'll have to study this after system design and whatnot.


Should probably take notes on firewalls and whatnot. I thought that would be a good idea honestly. After this though I should probably get going on the documentation of Js2 and soilTool and then start working on the shiny re-write. Then after this I can focus more on distributed systems and probably should start watching that microservices video on one of the projects.
