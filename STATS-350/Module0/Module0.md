### Setup
- Install R and RStudio
- Syballus and getting people read  

### Material
I think i'll split up the material into separate .md files in the future, but the first module is mainly review and whatnot, so I guess it doesn't matter that much in the grand scheme of things.

Counting and basic combinatorics:
- Multiplication principle: If there are two sequential decisions you multiply the outcomes to get the total number of outcomes.
- Sampling with an without replacement. When sampling with replacement, you replace the thing you picked, and the idea is that the probability of picking the next guy doesn't change. Without replacement just measn picking the next guy does change.
- **Permutations:** The number of ways you can arrange/order r objects from a collection of n, $P(n,r)=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
- **Combinations:** Number of unordered selections, so order doesn't matter. Like the number of sets, $C(n,r)=\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}$. N is the total number whilst r is the number we're choosing.

Functions:
- domain is inputs and range is the outputs.
- An inverse of a function seems to be its output is the domain and inputs are the range if that makes sense. 

And of course sets and complements and whatnot. The set of irrational numbers contains more elements.
