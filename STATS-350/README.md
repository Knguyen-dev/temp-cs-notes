# STAT-S 350 Notes

I do already know some level of statistics, but I think these notes could contain a good refresher. I mean I took AP statistics, and also CSCIB-351 made me re-learn statistics. I think after this, I should probably compile everything into one folder. Akin to how I plan to compile the physics into one folder.
