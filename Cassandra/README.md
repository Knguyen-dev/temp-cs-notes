# Cassandra Notes 

I'm learning Cassandra just for a little bit because of its value in distributed systems:
- Forces you to think about partition keys and clustering from the start 
- Confront the reality of eventual consistency and CAP theorem more directly
- Teaches ring topology and how data is distributed across nodes 
- Query limitations forces you to design your data model around "access patterns"
