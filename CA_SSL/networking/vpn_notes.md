# Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)

### What is a VPN and how does it work?
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) re-routes your internet traffic through a remote server. Instead of your traffic going directly from your device to a website, it's first encrypted and sent to a VPN server. The VPN server then forwards the request to the destination website. As a result, the site only sees the VPN server’s IP address, not yours.

Normally, your internet traffic goes directly through your ISP, which can see what websites you visit. But with a VPN, your data is encrypted before it even reaches your ISP. Then the ISP  your data to the VPN server, but now the ISP can't read or see where the request going.

The main benefit is that VPNs let you access resources or websites that might be blocked or restricted based on location, or only accessible within a private network (like a company intranet).

### Types of VPNs

* **Personal VPNs**: These are the most common for individual users. Instead of connecting to a private intranet, you're connecting to a public VPN provider's servers to browse the internet securely and privately.

* **Site-to-Site VPNs**: Used mostly by businesses to securely connect entire office networks across different locations.

* **Remote Access VPNs**: Allow individual users to connect to a private network remotely—like logging into your workplace or school network from home.
