### List




## Credits


1. IP, Subnetting, DNS. IPv4 vs V6. How DNS resolution works. When you'd use TCP vs UDP. Know ports, connections vs connectionless
  - routing and switching 
  - common protocols like tcp/ip, udp, icmp
  - packet sniffing and network traffic analyssi

2. OSI model, know the 7 layers conceptually. Understand how sockets and ports bind. 
3. Practical Networks:
  - Request/response cycles, status codes, headers, cookies
  - DNS and CDN, Caching and TTL, how cdns impact routing
  - How HTTPS works, TLS handshake
  - Certificates, CA, and encryption basics
  - NAT, firewalls, public vs private IPs. Port forwarding and security groups.


3. For distributed systems:
  - ping, traceroute/tracert, curl, telnet, netstat, ss, tcpdump wireshark.
  - Know the common protocols. What is a packet, segment, and datagram.


4. Cloud and distributed systems concepts. So you may wnat to move this over to somewhere else.

You should probably be learning about sockets during the midsts of this.
